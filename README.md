# MLiy
MLiy (pronounced “Emily”) is a machine learning platform that allows data scientists to provision and manage processing power in the cloud. It provides an easy-to-use website to install customizable sets of machine learning software for use in data analysis and exploration. This allows data scientists to focus on data analysis rather than how to get the hardware or software they need.
